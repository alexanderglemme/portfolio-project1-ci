            <h1>About Dagmars Artistry</h1>
            <p>Dagmar Glemme’s paintings, lithographs and sculptures
                in ceramic, glass, bronze and stone have been shown in
                over 300 exhibitions world‐wide. Dagmar's many pieces
                of public art include a painting for peace displayed at
                the UN in New York, the sculpture "Tree of Knowledge"
                outside Art Clinic in Jönköping and four large murals in
                the Church of Resurrection in Fort de France, Matinique.
                In recent years Dagmar Glemme has designed glass
                sculptures in the furnaces at Berongo Fine Arts in
                Murano/Venice, Schott/Jena in Brazil, Bergdala
                Studioglas and Studio Micke Johansson, Örsjö. Dagmar Glemme´s largest public work to date is "Weg der
                Steine" (“Avenue of the Stones”), where wenty‐one large
                stone scuptures (2‐3 meters tall) adorn the streets in the
                heart of Uelzen, Germany. Dagmar is also the current artist
                chosen to paint the windows of a two‐story tall advent
                calendar displayed on the facade of the old Town Hall of
                Uelzen each December.
                Dagmar Glemme also produces art and music films, for
                example “The Six Elements” (2008) and an artistic portrait
                of the Swedish province of Halland, interpreted through the
                eyes of local musicians, artists and writers. She has
                designed several CD art covers and in 2012 she wrote and
                illustrated her first children's book, named "Colorful Lies".
                Dagmar Glemme is a member of KRO (The Swedish Artists´
                National Organization) and NVSK.</p>
