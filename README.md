# Dagmar Glemme Art
The main goals of this website is to (1) provide an introduction to the artistry of the great artist and sculpter Dagmar Glemme, (2) provide information about the artists whereabouts and main place of business and (3) encourage potential costomers to reach out to the artist for a planned visit.

The targeted audience for this website are people who in one way or form might have seen or heard about an artpiece of Dagmars and wants to know more about the artist and her artistry. It is like a CV in the sense that it is aimed to leave the user with a clear understanding of what type of artist Dagmar is and also give an approximate taste of how she expresses her ideas in different types of materials. The ways it differs from a CV is first and foremost the format in such that the target audience aren't just employers/recruiters, but also potential art byers. This leaves room for longer format text and a more playfull approach to the layout. The artist herself has even encouraged me to be playful with the spacing of different elements, formalia is therefore secondary. The website is also in and of itself designed to be a pleasant user experience in a broader sense than just a snappy CV.

The usefulness of the website is broad. It can be used for areas such as marketing the artist towards both private and corporate art byers, or even as a resource for journalists or gallerists writing about Dagmar Glemme.

# Features
## Header
In the top left the user will see a navbar with big buttons containing fontawesome icons to indicate the different pages of the website. The circles around the icons respond with a color change when hovered on, and also activates when clicked to indicate where the user currently is on the website. The size of the buttons are however not responsive. This should be seen as a feature rather than a bug, because it was requested by the client as a way to make it easy for people with impaired vision to easily be able to navigate through the page, despite screensize.


























## Footer!
The footer also features matching buttons with icons that lead the user to Dagmars social media outlets by opening a new tab in the users browser, and redirecting them to said tab.
## Visit Dagmar page
This page features all of the above and in addition an iframe element containing a fully interactable and ready to use google maps session with Dagmars address already entered. This is a way of engouraging the user to take action and start planning their route to Dagmar Glemme Art Center. While on the site with an iphone, all phonenumbers on screen are by iOS default clickable, and will open a menu that suggests the user to call Dagmar or to cancel the action.
