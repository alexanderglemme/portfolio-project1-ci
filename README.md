# Dagmar Glemme Art
The main goals of this website is to (1) provide an introduction to the artistry of the great artist and sculpter Dagmar Glemme, (2) provide information about the artists whereabouts and main place of business and (3) encourage potential costomers to reach out to the artist for a planned visit.

The targeted audience for this website are people who in one way or form might have seen or heard about an artpiece of Dagmars and wants to know more about the artist and her artistry. It is like a CV in the sense that it is aimed to leave the user with a clear understanding of what type of artist Dagmar is and also give an approximate taste of how she expresses her ideas in different types of materials. The ways it differs from a CV is first and foremost the format in such that the target audience aren't just employers/recruiters, but also potential art byers. This leaves room for longer format text and a more playfull approach to the layout. The artist herself has even encouraged me to be playful with the spacing of different elements, formalia is therefore secondary. The website is also in and of itself designed to be a pleasant user experience in a broader sense than just a snappy CV.

The usefulness of the website is broad. It can be used for areas such as marketing the artist towards both private and corporate art byers, or even as a resource for journalists or gallerists writing about Dagmar Glemme.

# Features
## Header
![header](assets/images/screenshot-header.jpg)
In the top left the user will see a navbar throughout the website with big buttons containing fontawesome icons to indicate the different pages of the website. The circles around the icons respond with a color change when hovered on, and also activates when clicked to indicate where the user currently is on the website. The size of the buttons are however not responsive. This should be seen as a feature rather than a bug, because it was requested by the client as a way to make it easy for people with impaired vision to navigate through the pages, despite screensize.

## Footer
![Footer on homepage](assets/images/schreenshot-bottom-of-page.jpg)

![Footer on homepage](assets/images/schreenshot-bottom-of-page.jpg)
The home page features a banner situated right under the heading, containing an oilpainting on canvas to the right and the logo to the left. This landing was designed to give a professional impression and to also quickly get the user a taste of the type of art on the website.
The homepage also features an "about Dagmar" section accompanied by some more images of glass art inside circle containers. The thought process behind this was to quickly engage the user and maybe answer some key questions about dagmars artistry, questions that the user might have had before entering the site.
The playfull design of the circles are placed in a manner that reminds the user of some sort of movement because of the way they aline (while sceensize > ca1000px), like a swipe of a paintbrush, or of planets of lesser mass alining around some great mass in cosmos.

## Gallery page

These photos are as stated just a sample of artworks, and will continually be updated with newer more relevant work. As of now these are the best images at hand but will as stated be updated.
